Sure, here's a possible readme for your Edge-Detection project:

Edge Detection ROS2 Package
This is a ROS2 package that demonstrates edge detection using OpenCV and ROS2 topics. The package includes two nodes: HandPublisher and image_publisher.

Prerequisites
This package was developed and tested with ROS2 Foxy on Ubuntu 20.04. Before running the nodes, you'll need to install the following packages:

ROS2 Foxy: http://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html
OpenCV: sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
Usage
To use this package, clone the repository and build it with colcon:

bash
Copy code
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/XunQAQ/Edge-Detection.git
cd ..
colcon build
Then source the setup file and run the nodes:

arduino
Copy code
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run edge_detection HandPublisher
ros2 run edge_detection image_publisher
The HandPublisher node subscribes to the video_frames topic and processes the image to detect a red edge. If the red edge is found, the node publishes a Twist message with an angular velocity of 0.5 to turn right, and if not found, it publishes a Twist message with a linear velocity of 0.5 to move forward.

The image_publisher node publishes sensor_msgs/Image messages to the video_frames topic.
